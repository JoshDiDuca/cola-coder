# Cola-Coder AI Improvement Backlog

Persistent issue/opportunity log for the autonomous improvement loop. Append new
items with a stable ID; only mark `done` after a validated fix. Severity:
critical / high / medium / low. Status: open / in-progress / done / dropped.

Ratings reflect VERIFICATION against the code, not just an agent's first guess —
e.g. BUG-004 was downgraded to not-a-bug after checking the math.

---

## Open

- **INFER-001** [inference, medium] `open` — Server SSE streaming strips the
  prompt echo with `chunk.startswith(prompt_text)` on the raw string, but
  `decode(encode(prompt))` is not guaranteed byte-identical (BPE), so the echo
  strip can fail and leak the prompt into the stream. `server.py` ~557, ~702.
  `generate_stream` itself handles this correctly via prev_decoded_len; the
  server re-implements it more fragilely. Fix: strip by tokenized prompt length.

- **INFER-004** [inference, low] `open` — Streaming `completion_tokens` is
  incremented per SSE chunk, not per token, so OpenAI-compatible usage stats are
  wrong for streamed responses. `server.py` ~565, ~626. Fix: count via
  tokenizer or track token count in the stream loop.

- **EVAL-004** [eval, low] `open` — `execute_code` with empty `test_code` trivially
  "passes" (no tests to fail) and counts toward pass@k. `evaluation/runner.py`
  ~125-149. Fix: skip/warn on empty tests.

- **INFER-005** [inference, low] `open` — `generate_batch` doesn't accept/forward
  `min_p` (silently uses 0.0). `generator.py` ~471-508. API inconsistency.

- **DATA-002** [data-quality, low] `open` — `MixedDataset` (data/dataset.py) is
  dead code — never constructed anywhere. Either integrate into the data path or
  remove. (mix_temperature config already removed.)

- **SEC-001** [security, low] `open` — Tighten malware-scan config defaults so
  in-stream scanning can't be silently disabled into an unsafe state; document
  the safe defaults. (From a prior audit; verify current defaults.)

- **MODEL-001** [model, medium] `open` — MoE is now loadable/runnable but upcycle
  only INITIALIZES experts; there is no pipeline stage to FINE-TUNE the upcycled
  MoE (needs ~10-20% training compute to differentiate experts). Opportunity:
  add stage 7.5.

- **MODEL-002** [model, low] `open` — `ModelConfig.total_params` reports the dense
  FFN count for MoE configs (display only; undercounts expert params).

- **OPS-001** [tooling, low] `open` (deferred for user) — storage split-brain:
  configs/storage.yaml → E:/cola-coder-data vs config.checkpoint.output_dir →
  ./checkpoints. Needs the user's decision; do not unilaterally resolve.

## Done

- **DATA-004** [data-quality, high] `done` (2026-06-11) — DISCOVERED while
  validating DATA-001: exact+minhash dedup SILENTLY NO-OP'd ON WINDOWS. The
  cycle-1 mmap optimization (`np.load(output_file, mmap_mode="r")`) kept the
  file locked, so `os.replace(tmp, output_file)` raised PermissionError that the
  `except Exception` swallowed as "Deduplication failed. Keeping all chunks." —
  on the user's primary platform. The cycle-1 smoke missed it by using a full
  load, not mmap. Fix: extracted `dedup_npy_file()` in data/dedup.py that closes
  the memmap handle BEFORE os.replace; prepare_data calls it. Tests:
  test_dedup.py TestDedupNpyFile (real mmap+replace roundtrip on a temp file).
- **DATA-001** [data-quality, medium] `done` (2026-06-11) — within-file
  near-duplicate (MinHash) dedup wired: `CrossDatasetDeduplicator.
  deduplicate_self_array` + `prepare_data --dedup minhash --dedup-threshold`,
  menu 3-way choice, `[dedup]` extra (datasketch). Falls back to exact + loud
  warning when datasketch absent. Validated real near-dup removal with
  datasketch 1.10 installed (1-token-diff chunk dropped, distinct kept). Tests:
  test_dedup.py TestSelfMinHashDedup + TestDedupNpyFile.
- **DATA-003** [data-quality, high] `done` (2026-06-10) — `prepare_repo_context_data.py`
  silently fell back to `eos_id` for missing `<|repo|>/<|/repo|>/<|file|>/<|/file|>`
  tokens, emitting POISON training data (the entire repo/file structure became
  eos tokens). These tokens are NOT in the base tokenizer's SPECIAL_TOKENS —
  only `add_context_tokens()` adds them — and the script is menu-wired (run with
  no args), so a normally-trained tokenizer triggers it. Now `_resolve_context_
  token_ids` reports missing tokens and main() `cli.fatal`s with the exact
  remedy instead of producing broken data. Test: test_repo_context_data.py (4).
- **EVAL-002** [eval, low (was high)] `done` (2026-06-10) — VERIFIED: real but
  currently harmless (no FAKE_PACKAGES entry has a dot). JS/TS import regex char
  class now includes `.` so dotted hallucinated packages are matched. Test:
  test_safety_evaluator.py TestDottedPackageDetection.
- **INFER-002** [inference, medium] `done` (2026-06-10) — try/finally around the
  `generate_group` prefill+expand+decode guarantees `clear_caches()` even on
  exception; OOM handler now clears before `empty_cache()` so the retry actually
  reclaims VRAM. Test: test_loop_cycle_fixes.py
  `test_generate_group_clears_cache_on_decode_exception`.
- **EVAL-001** [eval, medium] `done` (2026-06-10) — `compute_pass_at_k` now
  returns None (not 0.0) when no problem has >= k samples and logs a warning;
  warns on partial exclusion; `format_results` shows "n/a"; auto_eval hardened.
  Tests: test_loop_cycle_fixes.py TestPassAtKSemantics.
- **INFER-003** [inference, low] `done` (2026-06-10) — `_apply_repetition_penalty`
  returns the mutated logits; caller reassigns. Test: TestRepetitionPenaltyReturn.

## Not a bug (verified)

- **BUG-004 (min_p NaN)** — FALSE POSITIVE. `_min_p_filter` threshold =
  `min_p * probs.max()`; for `min_p ≤ 1` the argmax token always satisfies
  `probs >= threshold`, so it is never masked → all-`-inf` is impossible. Only a
  defensive guard for misconfigured `min_p > 1` would add value (very low).

- **EVAL-003 (secret regex false positives)** — NOT A BUG (verified). The
  hardcoded-secret pattern requires a QUOTED key (`"api_key": "..."`) and only
  matches 8+ char values. Flagging secret-shaped quoted assignments in generated
  code is the INTENDED behavior of a safety probe, not a false positive —
  whether the value is a placeholder or real, the model emitting that shape is
  what we measure. Documented by test_safety_evaluator.py
  TestSecretAndDangerousDetection. Refining to exclude obvious placeholders is a
  possible low-value nicety, not a correctness fix.
